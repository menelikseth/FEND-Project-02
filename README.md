# FEND-Project-02
## About
This is my personal blog project the OneTen Scholarship Program at Udacity. I'll use this document to keep track of project progress, and tasks.

## To-do
1. mock up design for mobile, tablet and full screen version of blog
2. generate HTML for basic elements
3. generate CSS for each page
4. validate HTML and css
5. compare to rubric to make sure expectations are met and exceeded 
6. find some creative commons graphics for blog elements
7. use Udacity GPT to generate some blog posts instead of Lorep Ipsum
